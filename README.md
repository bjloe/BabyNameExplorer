The main Jupyter notebook in this repository was inspired by an article on FiveThirtyEight.com entitled 
"How to Tell Someone's Age When All You Know Is Her Name." The notebook recreates some of the graphics in 
the article and applies the group-apply-combine technique which is a very powerful tool to have in your
toolbox.
